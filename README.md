# Portfolio Site

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.1.

## Introduction

A single page Angular application for my personal portfolio website. Decided to use minimum and simple animations for a minimalistic approach when creating this site.

## Technology

This site is powered by:
- Angular
- Bootstrap
- HTML
- CSS
- TypeScript

## Color Scheme

The color scheme I used is based from this color palette: https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palettes/mermaid-lagoon/
